  name: "Dr. Alperen"
  surname: "Acemoglu"
  company: "Italian Institute of Technology (Advanced Robotics Lab)"
  title: "5G Telesurgery"
  bio: "Alperen Acemoglu received his B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Istanbul Tech- nical University, Turkey, in 2012 and M.Sc. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Turkey, in 2014. During his masterâ€™s studies, he worked on bio-inspired microswim- mers which are aimed to be used in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and opening clogged arteries. He received his Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering and Robotics from Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) and Universita` Degli Studi di Genova, Italy, in 2018. Dur- ing his Ph.D. studies, he worked on developing a compact magnetic laser scanner to enable the high-speed laser scanning and non-contact laser tissue ablations in hard-to-reach surgical sites. Currently, he is a postdoctoral researcher in Biomedical Robotics Laboratory, Department of Advanced Robotics, IIT. His research interests include medical robotics, 5G telesurgery, laser microsurgery, magnetically-actuated micromanipulators, and microswimmers."
