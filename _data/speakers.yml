  surname: "Alexis"
  company: "Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Department of Engineering Cybernetics)"
  title: "Field-hardened Resilient Robotic Autonomy"
  bio: "Kostas Alexis obtained his Ph.D. in the field of aerial robotics control and collaboration from the University of Patras, Greece in 2011. His Ph.D. research was supported by the Greek National-European Commission Excellence scholarship. After successfully defending his Ph.D. thesis, he was awarded a Swiss Government fellowship and moved to Switzerland and ETH Zurich. From 2012 to June 2015 he held the position of Senior Researcher at the Autonomous Systems Lab of ETH Zurich, leading the lab efforts in the fields of control and path planning for advanced navigational and operational autonomy. During summer 2015 he moved to the Computer Science & Engineering Department of the University of Nevada, Reno where he got tenured in 2020. Since Fall 2020 he moved to the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology as a Full Professor. He is the founder and director of the Autonomous Robots Lab (https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/) involving more than 15 researchers and conducting research in the domain of autonomy, perception, planning and control. Dr. Alexis' research has received multiple awards, includes the world record in unmanned aircraft endurance, and has been funded by a variety of sources including DARPA, NSF, DOE, USDA, NASA, the European Commission, the Norwegian Research Council the private sector and other sources."

  surname: "Acemoglu"
  company: "Italian Institute of Technology (Advanced Robotics Lab)"
  title: "5G Telesurgery"
  bio: "Alperen Acemoglu received his B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey, in 2012 and M.Sc. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Turkey, in 2014. During his masterâ€™s studies, he worked on bio-inspired microswimmers which are aimed to be used in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and opening clogged arteries. He received his Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering and Robotics from Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) and Universita` Degli Studi di Genova, Italy, in 2018. During his Ph.D. studies, he worked on developing a compact magnetic laser scanner to enable the high-speed laser scanning and non-contact laser tissue ablations in hard-to-reach surgical sites. Currently, he is a postdoctoral researcher in Biomedical Robotics Laboratory, Department of Advanced Robotics, IIT. His research interests include medical robotics, 5G telesurgery, laser microsurgery, magnetically-actuated micromanipulators, and microswimmers."
