  title: "Saltatorial Locomotion on Terrain Obstacles"
  description: "High-power jumping robots can rapidly traverse large obstacles, but the resulting fast and forceful motion is challenging for control and estimation.  In this talk, I will present my work developing a small monopedal jumping robot, Salto-1P.  Salto-1P achieved superlative jumping performance and demonstrated precise control, onboard estimation, and dynamic transitions between jumping and balancing."
