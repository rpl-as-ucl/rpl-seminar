  title: "Contact Sensing for Robot Grasping"
  description: "In this talk, I will present how tactile and force information can be used to obtain richer information relevant to the grasping and manipulation of objects. I will discuss how tactile perception enables a system to go from raw tactile and force signals into higher level contact information, such as slippage, object pose, material identification, and collision detection."

  title: "Saltatorial Locomotion on Terrain Obstacles"
  description: "High-power jumping robots can rapidly traverse large obstacles, but the resulting fast and forceful motion is challenging for control and estimation.  In this talk, I will present my work developing a small monopedal jumping robot, Salto-1P.  Salto-1P achieved superlative jumping performance and demonstrated precise control, onboard estimation, and dynamic transitions between jumping and balancing."

  title: "Reliability in Robot Learning: Developing resilient autonomous systems for society"
  description: "Autonomous robots have the potential to transform our everyday lives, yet most of todayâ€™s robots struggle in the real world. My research focuses on this issue by building foundations of robust deep learning and autonomy. In this talk, I will describe some of our recent work on analyzing the robustness properties of deep neural networks, robustifying learned deep RL policies, and estimating the reachable sets of neural feedback loops."
