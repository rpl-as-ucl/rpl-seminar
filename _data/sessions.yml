  title: "Contact Sensing for Robot Grasping"
  description: "In this talk, I will present how tactile and force information can be used to obtain richer information relevant to the grasping and manipulation of objects. I will discuss how tactile perception enables a system to go from raw tactile and force signals into higher level contact information, such as slippage, object pose, material identification, and collision detection."

  title: "Saltatorial Locomotion on Terrain Obstacles"
  description: "High-power jumping robots can rapidly traverse large obstacles, but the resulting fast and forceful motion is challenging for control and estimation.  In this talk, I will present my work developing a small monopedal jumping robot, Salto-1P.  Salto-1P achieved superlative jumping performance and demonstrated precise control, onboard estimation, and dynamic transitions between jumping and balancing."

  title: "Reliability in Robot Learning: Developing resilient autonomous systems for society"
  description: "Autonomous robots have the potential to transform our everyday lives, yet most of todayâ€™s robots struggle in the real world. My research focuses on this issue by building foundations of robust deep learning and autonomy. In this talk, I will describe some of our recent work on analyzing the robustness properties of deep neural networks, robustifying learned deep RL policies, and estimating the reachable sets of neural feedback loops."

  title: "New Perspectives in the Design and Control of Bionic Limb."
  description: "Since the 16th century, science and engineering have endeavored to match the richness and complexity of the human hand sensory-motor system. In the last decade novel theories and technologies, e.g. soft robotics and the simplification of the mechanical design, suggest a new promising direction towards the next generation of high technologic bionic aids. This talk aims to exploit the potential of these emerging trends and proposes new strategies to optimise the performance of an artificial hand, achieving a useful trade-off between grasping performance and mechanical design/control complexity."
