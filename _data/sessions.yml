  title: "The Machine Learning of Time: Past and Future."
  description: "Visual artificial intelligence automatically interprets what happens in visual data like videos. Today’s research strives with queries like: “Is this person playing basketball?”; “Find the location of the brain stroke”; or “Track the glacier fractures in satellite footage”. All these queries are about visual observations already taken place. Today’s algorithms focus on explaining past visual observations. Naturally, not all queries are about the past: “Will this person draw something in or out of their pocket?”; “Where will the tumour be in 5 seconds given breathing patterns and moving organs?”; or, “How will the glacier fracture given the current motion and melting patterns?”. For these queries and all others, the next generation of visual algorithms must expect what happens next given past visual observations. Visual artificial intelligence must also be able to prevent before the fact, rather than explain only after it. In this talk, I will present my vision on what these algorithms should look like, and investigate possible synergies with other fields of science, like biomedical research, astronomy and others. Furthermore, I will present some recent works and applications in this direction within my lab and spinoff."

  title: "Field-hardened Resilient Robotic Autonomy."
  description: "This talk will present our contributions in the domain of field-hardened resilient robotic autonomy and specifically on multi-modal sensing-degraded GPS-denied localization and mapping, informative path planning, and robust control to facilitate reliable access, exploration, mapping and search of challenging environments such as subterranean settings. The presented work will, among others, emphasize on fundamental developments taking place in the framework of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and the research of the CERBERUS (https://www.subt-cerberus.org/) team, alongside work on nuclear site characterization and infrastructure inspection. Relevant field results from both active and abandoned underground mines as well as tunnels in the U.S. and in Switzerland will be presented. In addition, a selected set of prior works on long-term autonomy, including the world-record on unmanned aircraft endurance will be briefly overviewed. The talk will conclude with directions for future research to enable advanced autonomy and resilience, alongside the necessary connection to education and the potential for major broader impacts to the benefit of our economy and society."

  title: "New Perspectives in the Design and Control of Bionic Limb."
  description: "Since the 16th century, science and engineering have endeavored to match the richness and complexity of the human hand sensory-motor system. In the last decade novel theories and technologies, e.g. soft robotics and the simplification of the mechanical design, suggest a new promising direction towards the next generation of high technologic bionic aids. This talk aims to exploit the potential of these emerging trends and proposes new strategies to optimise the performance of an artificial hand, achieving a useful trade-off between grasping performance and mechanical design/control complexity."

  title: "5G Telesurgery"
  description: "Surgical robots and their control consols are being developed to perform telesurgeries for more than 30 years. The first telesurgery involving a human patient was performed in 2001, known as Lindbergh operation. However, the reproduction of this feat and popularization of the telesurgery was impossible due to the limited availability of surgical robots and the lack of fast and reliable network connections. Now, with the introduction of 5G mobile networks and with the new surgical robots, this concept is becoming practical. Recently, we performed an experiment of a remote 5G robotic laser microsurgery in Milano, Italy. In our experiment, surgeons successfully performed complex transoral laser microsurgeries on the vocal cords of an adult human cadaver located 15 km away from them. Our results demonstrate that surgical expertise can be exploited and shared efficiently using the new 5G telecommunication standard. During the talk, we will be discussing this 5G telesurgery experience, in detail the telesurgery setup, the integrated robotic systems, results of the experiments and current limitations/future directions."

  title: "Reliability in Robot Learning: Developing resilient autonomous systems for society"
  description: "Autonomous robots have the potential to transform our everyday lives, yet most of today’s robots struggle in the real world. My research focuses on this issue by building foundations of robust deep learning and autonomy. In this talk, I will describe some of our recent work on analyzing the robustness properties of deep neural networks, robustifying learned deep RL policies, and estimating the reachable sets of neural feedback loops."

  title: "Saltatorial Locomotion on Terrain Obstacles"
  description: "High-power jumping robots can rapidly traverse large obstacles, but the resulting fast and forceful motion is challenging for control and estimation.  In this talk, I will present my work developing a small monopedal jumping robot, Salto-1P.  Salto-1P achieved superlative jumping performance and demonstrated precise control, onboard estimation, and dynamic transitions between jumping and balancing."

  title: "Contact Sensing for Robot Grasping"
  description: "In this talk, I will present how tactile and force information can be used to obtain richer information relevant to the grasping and manipulation of objects. I will discuss how tactile perception enables a system to go from raw tactile and force signals into higher level contact information, such as slippage, object pose, material identification, and collision detection."
